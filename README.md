## ARK.io Translations

We have taken the time to refactor the whole website, and have included modular language files to allow for easier management.  

You can assist the ARK.io project by providing translation from English into your native tongue.  A full list of the current language can be found in the [translations directory](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ARK.io-Translations/tree/master/translations) within this repository.

When new lines need to be translated, we will add them at the end of the file so that you can easily see what has not yet been translated into your language.

## How-To (Current Languages)
If you'd like to translate a new line for an existing language:

* 1. Download the ```<your-lang>.json``` file from this repository or edit here on GitHub
* 2. Open in your favorite text editor (eg. Notepad ++) or edit here on GitHub
* 3. Edit only the second part of the line, adding your translation.  For example:

```"A Wallet for Everyone": "A Wallet for Everyone",``` -> ```"A Wallet for Everyone": "Your Translation Here",```
* 4. Submit a Pull-Request and wait until we merge

Specific terminology such as ARK, SmartBridge, the 'Point. Click. Blockchain.' motto, and 'All-in-One Blockchain Solutions' shouldn't be translated.

## How-To (New Langugages)
If you'd like to provide a translation for a language not yet listed:

* 1. Download the base ```en.json``` file from this repository or edit here on GitHub
* 2. Open in your favorite text editor or edit here on GitHub
* 3. Edit only the second part of the line, adding your translation.  For example:

```"A Wallet for Everyone": "A Wallet for Everyone",``` -> ```"A Wallet for Everyone": "Your Translation Here",```
* 4. Submit a Pull-Request and wait until we merge

Keep in mind that specific terminology such as ARK, SmartBridge, the 'Point. Click. Blockchain.' motto, and 'All-in-One Blockchain Solutions' shouldn't be translated.

## Contributing

Translations are not included as part of the regular development GitHub bounty. However, new untranslated languages will receive some ARK tokens for the complete translation of files. Join the [ARK slack](https://ark.io/slack), and contact 'boldninja' before starting a translation to a new language in order to avoid duplication of any effort in the event a language is already being translated.
